<p>Ideas: </p>
 <ul>
  <li>Text based game</li>
  <li>calculator</li>
  <li>Unit converter</li>
  <li>Alphbatise paragraphs of text</li>
  <li>Random Name generator</li>
  <li>News spider</li>
</ul>

<h2>text based game</h2>
Rather something simple like zork or an idle game.

<h2>calculator</h2>
A simple calculator, it would be fun to show more complex functions though.

<h2>unit converter</h2>
This would be a nice simple project. I could make do other functions for example calculators force .etc

<h2>alphabatize texts</h2>
This would be good for showing my ability of using sorting algorithms.

<h2>Random name generator</h2>
really simple

<h2>News spider</h2>
This could be a good project later on. the Programme would take the top resulting pages from news websites based on a keyword and take the first few paragraphs from a few to create document with them in? I could implement quite a few functions in to this but i could see this being the most challenging project out of those listed so far
